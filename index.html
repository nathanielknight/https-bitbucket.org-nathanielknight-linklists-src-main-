        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>This is a web page that makes a checklist out of the link that you follow to get here.</p>

        <h2>I don't see a checklist&hellip;</h2>
        <p>
            You probably followed a link that didn't have a checklist in it. You can make a new one
            by clicking on the "New" button up there. Go ahead, try it!
        </p>

        <h2>How does this work?</h2>
        <p>
            When you load this page, it runs some code that looks at the web address.
            It also saves the items you check off so that you can reload the page without
            clearing the list. You can read the source code
            <a href="https://bitbucket.org/nathanielknight/linklists/">here</a>
            if you want to.
        </p>

        <h2>Who is Nathaniel Knight?</h2>
        <p>He's a fellow from Vancouver. He made this website.</p>
